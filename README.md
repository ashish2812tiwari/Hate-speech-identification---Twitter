# Hate-speech-identification---Twitter
# Overview

This project aims to identify **hate speech** using *machine learning binary classification algorithms*.
** Baseline models included Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression. The final model was a **Logistic Regression** model that used TD-IDF for feature engineering.
It produced an F1 score of 0.75 and Recall of 0.77. Therefore, our goal is to automate hate speech identification, which is a very challenging issue. And while this effort was able to start that process, more work needs to be done to prevent this content from appearing on public venues like Twitter.
